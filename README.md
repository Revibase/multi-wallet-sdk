# Multi-Wallet SDK

The Multi-Wallet SDK is a powerful tool for creating and managing on-chain multisig wallets on the Solana blockchain. It allows developers to set up secure, multi-signature wallets, facilitating decentralized control and secure transaction management. This codebase is partially adapted from [Squads Protocol](https://github.com/Squads-Protocol/v4/tree/main) to enhance multi-wallet support and flexibility.
